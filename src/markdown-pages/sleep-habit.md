### Background

I've started to take care of myself more for more than one year.
The main goal is to keep good physical and mental health.
To achieve goal I want to introduce good habits into my life. 

My good-habits-journey started when I decided to quit alcohol.
Then next things were introduced and a current complete list looks like follows:

1. no alcohol,
2. no nicotine,
3. physical activity (10000 steps every day at minimum),
4. maintain good BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist-to-hip ratio),
5. good sleep.

Most recently I decided to put more effort to improve my sleep and in this article
I would like to tell you my story about it.

### Why sleep became an important to me

In my personal notebook I remember this topic to be continuously something
that was on a list "I need to work on this ASAP" and really a lot of time passed since first mentions.
Finally after achieving previous goals/habits I started to feel that sleep should be next one.

I wanted to fight against bad sleeping habits that I had:

- I had no problems to sit by computer till 2-3am and get up 6-7am.
- Then, week by week, I was completely wasted on Friday (most often, but sometimes even faster).
- I was losing my spare time during weekends to sleep more.
- I felt uncomfortable in bed with laptop and something to eat and cell phone around me, but did nothing about it.
- I had difficulties to go to sleep - I felt overwhelmed by too much thinking and that's why I was using too much computer and video services right before sleep and every single day in bed.

### What I've changed to improve my sleep

As with all my bad habits - I started from an expert advices.
So I decided to listen to audiobook by Mathew Walker called "Why We Sleep".

Author convinced me, by showing simple examples and based on many studies that:
- sleep is one of the most important factors in human life on many fields (weight, health, diseases, ...)
- "I'll sleep when I die" mantra is completely false,

I always thought that so called "work-life balance" is something very important to me and I felt
that one of my values should be to focus on time after work to have also successful time at work.
*I don't want to see myself anymore as the one who write and commit code at night.*

Now I'm trying to achieve good sleep habit with advices from the book and below
you can find list of things that I'm doing now to make this habit happen:

- My daily plan allows me to sleep for 8 hours every day.
- I always go to sleep at the same time (22).
- I put aside cell phone / computer / TV 1 hour before I go to bed.
- I do have night shift enabled in cell phone and laptop.
- I eat 4 meals per day currently and last is 1 hour before I go to bed (4 meals because I'm on low calorie diet now).
- My bedroom is not sauna anymore and I started to like this chilly atmosphere.

### Is it working?

After 3 weeks of using above advices I do have a feeling that I feel better :-)

BUT 

Is better sleep really important? Based on studies mentioned in book: yes.
Based on my experience: I'll find out after some time. Below you can find my
initial list of metrics that I will try to measure to see if things go better:

- measure how many naps during the day I'm having (and how long they are),
- measure number of moments when I think negatively during the day,
- measure blood pressure every day in the morning and in the evening,
- measure heart rate every day in the morning and in the evening,
- measure number of steps I take every day - especially during weekend,
- measure percentage of monthly goals achieved (where 1 goal is equal to 100%),
- measure percentage of weekly goals achieved (1 goal per week is equal to 100%),
- measure percentage of daily goals achieved (1 goal per day is equal to 100%).

And will update this article after some time. If you find any other metrics that
could be measured than I'm happy to hear about them and will try to measure them also :-)


### Next habit

Diet!

I've already bought "How not to Diet" by Michael Greger and looking forward for a nice article in this series afterwards.
