One of the tools I'm using on daily basis is `direnv` (https://direnv.net/),
which simplifies the way you can keep any kind of configuration state within your environment variable.

I highly envourage you to start using it if you're not doing it yet
and if you don't feel that it can be useful try to be convinced by 12factor itself: https://12factor.net/config
