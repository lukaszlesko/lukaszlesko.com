### Preparation phase

Share company mission, vision and business goals with people
that will take place in workshop.

Give people at least 2 days to work in their own pace on their
ideas. Maybe they'll be asking questions - help them ASAP
and don't leave them without information (if you care about results
which is not so obvious ;-).

Do not invite people who don't want to participate, if there's someone
who wants to do his/hers job then you should take this into account.

Template to be used can be found here:
