I've read an article about remote Event Storming (https://blog.avanscoperta.it/it/2020/03/26/remote-eventstorming/)
and it inspired me to start writing
a series of articles about tools and methodologies than can be used by anyone to speed 
up his workflow and deliver products faster without making known mistakes.

## "Workshop" methodologies

- Event Storming
- ...

## Notations

- UML
- BPMN
- Event Storming ?rules?
- ...

## Tools

- Sticky notes
- Whiteboard
- ... 

## What is your favourite choice to work with? What am I missing here worth checking?

If you know any, let me know via Draft or Twiter and I'll check them for sure :)
If you want to extend this article together with me... then you're more than welcome!

## Q&A

- Are sticky notes enough for everyone without any additional rules? NO, people can get confused.
- Are UML enough for everyone? YES
- Is BPMN enough for everyone? YES
