(draft 2.04.2020 morning)

Yesterday I had a very nice talk with good Product Owner and we were
wondering what and how you can boost your transparency as a PO
to your team and outside world.

Topic is very important and commonly PO is not organizing his work
together with Scrum team on Scrum board probably, but this leads
to a moment where job that's being done by PO is hidden somewhere
(e-mails and other communication channels etc.).

## Solution

Below you can find my way and proposal for PO to work in a way
that everyone interested knows what's going:

1. Create a space where you can grab all your thoughts.
    Confluence sounds like a great tool.
    Create a space for every PROBLEM that you're solving, prefer
    one space for one problem, try not to combine them to keep things
    simple.
2. This space should be shared at least within your team and with
    all stakeholders that cooperate with you.
3. Keep every information in there, especially: problem definition,
    problem solution vision, goals, metrics, roadmap draft, epic drafts,
    meeting notes.
4. Create Kanban board for yourself as PO connected with above space.
    Keep there only things related to this problem and link both places
    together, at least team and stakeholders should be aware of them.

You can of course instead of Jira and Confluence use other tools,
but the concept and sharing rules still stays the same.

Hope you'll find it useful and if you're using more clever approach
then let me know!
