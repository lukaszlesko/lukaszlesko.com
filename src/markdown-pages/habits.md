Based on first article [/publications/sleep-habit] here I would like
to extend from time to time list of habits that I find useful to implement into
my life.

## Every day habit list

1. (0m) no alcohol
2. (0m) no nicotine
3. (0m) do not complain, always look for solutions and positives
4. (0m) maintain good BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist-to-hip ratio)
5. (0m) stay well hydrated every day
6. (0m) eat healthy and regularly
7. (0m) good sleep 8 hours per day
8. (0m) no TV / computer / cell phone one hour before sleep
9. (120m) training (10000 steps per day at minimum)
10. (30m) meditation
11. (15m) read one book and taking notes
12. (15m) listen to one book and taking notes
13. (15m) write private notes in notebook about day that was finished
14. (15m) read press
14. (15m) contact with family member
16. (15m) contact with friend/colleague
17. (15m) create a plan for next day
18. (15m) learn something new

Each item contains amount of time needed to be spent every day on given habit.
But what about switching contexts? It costs a lot of time unfortunately,
that's why it's not easy to keep this habits.
