Product Owner (or Product Manager), in short, is a person responsible for the success of some investment.
PO in many companies may differ and below I wanted to store for future reference some thoughts about it based on my experience. I think that they can be useful if you start your journey in this role or you’re already experienced, but just want to see it from another perspective :)
You can help, so if you find it useful and want to talk about it more deeply — I’ll be happy to get in touch to share more insights to be a better PO!
I divided the article into 3 steps which can be taken when you start a new initiative — I hope you’ll use something from it with your product :)

## The first step — define goals and make them transparent

Establish with stakeholders their expectations. You should establish at least:

1. Goals — from my perspective it’s the most critical part of the process of being a successful PO. In the future, I’ll write more deeply why it’s so important, but you can find inspiration on what to measure in this great article: https://android.jlelse.eu/50-ways-to-measure-your-mobile-apps-success-950087b529e0. There are many more metrics worth checking, use Medium to find best that fit your area of expertise.
2. Financial goals & budget — this should allow making choices, i.e. to hire a new specialist if that’s the right moment to do so,
3. Timeline — (or deadlines) to know if it’s worth to start this investment. I do prefer to work based on goals, but it’s worth to understand investors needs and that they not always are willing to pay for work that is not put in some timeframes,

Grab also other expectations — like new features that they want to introduce/test, inspirations that they do like and want to follow, SWOT analyses (if were already build), get along with data analysis they already took, etc.

Make clear notes afterward — later on, everyone should be aware of these goals to deliver the best work in the end. Keep goals in an open and transparent place (i.e. dedicated space in Confluence sounds like a great choice!).

## The second step — establish a vision and MVP scope

Bring a group of professionals — I prefer to have there to start: product owner, product designer, and developer. A marketing specialist can be also helpful in some circumstances but is not required for most cases. PO is a leader of this group and makes final decisions.

The role of this group is to establish what will be built in MVP. In a group, you should prepare:

1. Vision — as a clear statement understandable by everyone. Maybe expressed using What by How technique, i.e. “Create the easiest way to join telco operator, by introducing a new way of joining telco operator that no other operator has until this moment”.
2. Milestones — (in other words: versions plan, phases, stages, release plan) prepare a list of features, as an at least initial draft and divide them into milestones that’ll cover your future success.
3. Design rules — they’ll be needed to get along with the team/designers/marketing. They’re in most cases clear in companies, but it’s worth to rethink them at this stage and decide if you want to go with current Corporate Identity or maybe it needs some refinement?
4. Development team — it’s necessary to know what specialist you need to start working on the project. You should consult this with CTO/Tech Lead for sure to choose the best tech stack for your project.
5. Inspirations — in a form of apps/web/offline materials. It helps to determine if you’re aligned with your future team properly.
6. SWOT analysis — you probably know this and it’s always helpful to have it on your side.
7. Competitors — establish with whom you’re competing and how your product will be better. Also, establish KPIs that will show that your product is better than the one made by competitors.

## The third step — establish a development team and start iterations to deliver MVP

As soon as possible, with knowledge taken from previous work.
You should start as soon as possible, so don’t allow the second step to take too long, otherwise, you’ll regret as the third step is the most important one and in the reality, everything starts in here!
I prefer to use Scrum to make fast iterations and to deliver as soon as a possible product that can be tested by real users. I’ll write more about it in the future, but you can also use other methodologies to do this step right.

That’s all for now, will get back with more stuff in the future.
Cheers!
