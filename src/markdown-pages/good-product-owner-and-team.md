One important thought from today that I want to keep in here also for myself to remember that itâ€™s amazingly important.

Itâ€™s a draft and if you reach here â€” nice to see you and hopefully Iâ€™ll start to write longer stories next time ðŸ¤ž

## A great team

And now letâ€™s imagine that you have (initial) goals and vision (as described in the above post). What next you want to take care of?
From my point of view you should focus on building a great team, which should be built around these principles:

- Everyone knows itâ€™s responsibility.
- Everyone has only one responsibility at a time.
- Everyone knows that they will develop within this team and will be proud to work within a team.
- Thereâ€™s no one leader, everyone feels like an irreplaceable piece.
- Everyone can have a great idea, knows about it and knows that his/her idea will be evaluated and prioritized fairly.
- There are full transparency and trust to each otherâ€” open discussions and no hidden intentions behind the scene. Do you want to change your job after we finish our current stuff? Donâ€™t be afraid to talk about it openly as everyone can expect that more or less.

To be continued...
