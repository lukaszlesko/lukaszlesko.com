Book explains a five days process that you can use to check if your ideas/hypothesis are correct. In my own words the process looks like this:

    Monday: define goals / hypothesis / visualize future results.
    Tuesday: everyone builds sketches to be discussed later.
    Wednesday: build a storyboard.
    Thursday: build a prototype.
    Friday: interview with a customers.

Who should read this book? For sure it can be helpful to anyone who is responsible for bringing new ideas to the world and to make them happen.

There’s a lot of nice practices explained in the book. One of them I liked a lot, because I’ve “invented” something very similar during my work, so I’ll briefly explain it below.

## Brainstormings sucks… or not?

Story begins in January 2018. IT department was driven by me and around 10 developers worked in there.

We had to build a plan for a whole year.

Company decided to choose a framework called OGSM (I’ll write about it a little bit more in the future) and we’ve used it as our base and it was scaled vertically inside a company.

I knew that all of us were highly motivated and I knew that it’s only a matter of process to build something great out of plenty of ideas given by all of us.

So our process looked like follows:

    I’ve shared company-wise plan and goals for the company.
    Asked volunteers-only to prepare themselves with ideas based on this: http://businessopeners.nl/eng/our-books/the-one-page-business-strategy/
    Everyone had 8 minutes (including time for questions) to present his/hers ideas.
    Afterwards everyone had 1 normal vote and one SUPER vote to vote for presented ideas.
    We voted during meeting.
    Everything took around 2 hours.

Based on scores we had potential ideas to be worked on and to be discussed later with investors. It was fast and simple. What I do like from it is most of all:

    We all had time to prepare something in our own pace.
    We took voting to put priorities to ideas.

If you read Sprint the above stuff should be quite familiar to you :)

That’s why I’m a little bit proud… but most of all I feel relief.
Why I feel relieved

    Because there are other people who do great job and who thinks that group brainstormings without preparations sucks a lot!
