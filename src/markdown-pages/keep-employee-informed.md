### Intro

People want to work in companies where they can feel safe.
It's not the only needed ingredient, but if you want to your company be employee-friendly,
then for sure you should put some attention to this.

In this article I want to inspire you to work with your team in a way that people know what's going on around them,
rather than keeping secrets than can lead to lack of trust (and a lot of wasted energy).
And by doing this, you'll have more chances to make them work better, to be more happy and to make them feel more safe.

With this examples you'll also get a recipe what to do if you encounter similar situation.

### Project is flowing, everyone is safe...

Imagine that you're working in a team where it's clear what you're going to do,
what are your current goals and in general: you're participating in already established initiative/project.
It's a simple situation, because you probably already know that your boss wants
from you that you'll be a developer, tester, designer, copywriter etc.
and you're responsibility is more-or-less known.

Above situation can be called as a very clear and safe.

### Case 1: ...but nothing lasts forever

At some point in the future project will be finished
and people will be anxious about the future.
This is where good leader should keep them inform about future plans earlier than during the last project meeting.

### Summary

Don't let your people to be anxious and to feel unsafe - inform them and during
any organizational changes in your environment find time to talk and ask to peoples questions.
