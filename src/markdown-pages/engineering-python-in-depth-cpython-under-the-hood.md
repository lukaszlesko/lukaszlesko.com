To explore in more details my knowledge about Python I decided to take a look
what's inside Python under the hood.
Maybe now for the first time, but for the first time with a plan to deeply understand concepts
and the whole development process that powers up this great language and community around.

This will be my diary, so that from time to time I'll jump into it to leave some notes.
